Project Title: Database Optimization for YouTubeMusic

Project Description:
The project involved comprehensive optimization of the YoutubeMusic database to enhance query performance and streamline data access. Key tasks included refining table structures, creating and assessing indexes, and developing views to simplify data retrieval.

Key Steps:

Table Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis of the Playlist, Songs, and Playlist_Songs tables to understand data distribution, cardinality, and query patterns.
Index Creation: Created non-clustered indexes on critical columns to accelerate query performance for specific search conditions, employing techniques like clustered index seeks and non-clustered index scans.
Query Optimization: Analyzed query execution plans to identify performance bottlenecks, crafted optimized queries, and fine-tuned indexes to improve efficiency.
View Creation: Developed a view (Songs_Playlist_View) by joining tables to facilitate easier access to combined data, ensuring that the view's performance was optimal by assessing existing indexes and creating new ones when necessary.
Skills Acquired:

Database Optimization: Proficiency in analyzing and optimizing database performance through index creation, query optimization, and understanding query execution plans.
Indexing Strategies: Ability to assess data distribution and query patterns to strategically create indexes for improved performance.
SQL Proficiency: Enhanced skills in writing complex SQL queries, including joins, constraints, and index creation.
Data Modeling: Understanding of data relationships and the impact of database structures on query performance.
Performance Analysis: Capability to assess query performance using execution plans and take appropriate optimization actions based on findings.
This project equipped me with a robust skill set in database optimization, SQL query tuning, and data modeling, enabling more efficient handling of databases and ensuring better performance in data retrieval operations.
